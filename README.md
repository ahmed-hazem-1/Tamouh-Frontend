## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Dashboard is read-only (no data modification)
- Uses Supabase RLS for data security
- No server-side code required
- Static files only - can be deployed anywhere

## 🌐 Browser Support

- ✅ Chrome/Edge (recommended)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari
- ✅ Mobile browsers

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Dashboard shows "غير متصل" (Not Connected)
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify Supabase project is active
3. Ensure RLS policies allow read access

### No data showing
1. Verify database tables exist in Supabase
2. Check if there's actual data in the tables
3. Open browser developer tools to check for errors

### Real-time updates not working
1. Enable replication for all tables in Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to Database > Replication
3. Enable for: budget, employees, allowance_records, transactions

## 📧 Support
